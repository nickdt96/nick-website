    <h1>Purpose:</h1>
    <h4>What would you like your PWP to help you accomplish? This is a high-level goal akin to a Mission Statement. </h4>

        <p>Iâ€™d like for the website to help me boost my online presence by creating a digital portfolio to make it easy for people to find me and my work.</p>
</div>

<div>
    <h1>Audience:</h1>
    <h4>Who will be using or viewing your site? Who is this site designed for, and who is your audience comprised of? Could it be for your professional peers and other developers, potential employers, customers, or clients, etc.?</h4>

        <p>The site will be designed for potential clients and also artists/designers who want to view other people's work. I will mostly be targeting other web developers and web developing agencies, but also perhaps small businesses and studio artists who aren't as tech savvy. </p>
</div>

<div>
    <h1>Goal:</h1>
    <h4>This is should be a quantifiable goal if possible. For example, a goal for your PWP could be:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><h5>To acquire full or part-time employment or an internship.</h5></li>
            <li><h5>To increase sales and/or conversion rates for an existing business.</h5></li>
            <li><h5>To attract freelance clients.</h5></li>
            <li><h5>To serve as a gallery to showcase and promote your work.</h5></li>
            <li><h5>To increase the reach of a new or established social media presence (as measured via analytics tools)</h5></li>
        </ul>

        <p>My goal for this website is to increase chances of either getting hired at a web developing firm or getting the opportunity to do contract work for clients. I would also love for this website to open up collaboration opportunities with freelance web developers and designers.</p>

        <h1> Persona: </h1>
            <p><strong>Name:</strong> Lexi Kunze</p>
            <p><strong>Age:</strong> 32</p>
            <p><strong>Profession:</strong> Small business owner/studio artist who is looking to reach a wider audience with her work. Her small business is doing good on Etsy but now she is looking to have a branded website for her business.</p>

            <h4>Basic Info:</h4>
            <p>Technology:</p>
                <ul>
                 <li>Samsung Smart TV</li>
                 <li>Macbook Pro</li>
                 <li>iPad Pro</li>
                    <li>Latest version of iPhone</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Browsers used - Google Chrome and Safari</p>


    <p><strong>Proficiency:</strong> Moderate technology user</p>

    <h4>Attitudes & Behaviors:</h4>
    <p>Because she runs her own business she doesn't have time to figure out any of the typical website builders online, so instead she looks at fellow artists and small business owners who have their own website. Lexi uses mostly Instagram and LinkedIn for her social media and visits websites through Instagram bios to see different brands' websites frequently. </p>

    <h4>Frustrations & Needs:</h4>
    <p>Lexi has money saved but doesn't want to break the bank to have a website professionally done. She'd like to have the website done ASAP but has made a hard deadline of 3 months max. She is looking for someone who understands her basic needs for the website but also consumer needs and behaviors that will drive the design of the overall website. She wants to hire someone who is tech savvy but can still communicate to her possibilites for her website in ways she can understand. Along with this, she would also like to hire a candidate with some formal art background who can help her produce and display content and products nicely on her website.</p>

    <h4>Goals:</h4>
    <p>Lexi is mainly concerned about aesthetic and design of her website and wants someone who knows what it means to be "On Brand". She's willing to do research but overall her top candidate will have proven web development skills that she can see via their personal website, some interest or background in fine art and understands the importance of online presence.</p>

    <h4>User Story:</h4>
    <p>As a business owner and studio artist, I want to hire a fullstack web developer who can build an online ecommerce website that focuses on products and brand recognition.</p>
