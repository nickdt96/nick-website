    <h1>Content Strategy</h1>
    <h4>My site will have multiple pages that will highlight the following:</h4>
</div>

<div>
    <h3>Landing:</h3>
    <p>This will consist of only my name and a small description of what I focus on for work. The background will have some sort of moving element to make the page a little more interesting. You'll be able to scroll down and get small snippets of other parts of the website.</p>
</div>

<div>
    <h3>Gallery:</h3>
    <p>The gallery section on the homepage, gallery page and mobile views will be displayed parlor style, mostly because I find grid layouts to be boring. Once the user has clicked on an image the image will maximize into a larger view so the user is able to see details of the images/works that are in this section. The gallery page will be split into two sections, a physical works section and digital works section.</p>
</div>

<div>
    <h3>About:</h3>
    <p>This section will contain a photo of myself and small blurb about who I am, what I do and why, as well as a list of skills both in coding and graphic design. The about page will have these things as well but I might have a more in depth bio on the actual page instead of a small blurb.</p>

    <h3>Contact:</h3>
    <p>The contact section will contain a contact form for users to fill out if they need to get in touch or have inquiries. Might also add social links for LinkedIn, Instagram and Behance. I'll also have the contact link in the navigation section just jump to the contact form at the bottom of the homepage.</p>
